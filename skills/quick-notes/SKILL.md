# Quick Notes Skill

Use when the user says:
- "Remember: …" / "Note: …" / "Remember that …" → add a quick note (`quick_note_add`)
- "What did I note about X?" / "Search my notes for X" → search notes (`quick_note_search`)
- "List my notes" / "Notes from this week" / "Notes tagged work" → list notes (`quick_note_list`)

Notes are stored locally in `~/.jarvis/quick-notes/notes.json`. Optional `tag` helps filter (e.g. work, personal).
