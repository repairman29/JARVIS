# Quick Notes

Quick scratchpad for JARVIS: remember things, search notes, list by tag or date.

- **Add:** "Remember: buy milk" / "Note: call Mom tomorrow" → `quick_note_add`
- **Search:** "What did I note about the project?" → `quick_note_search`
- **List:** "List my notes from this week" / "Notes tagged work" → `quick_note_list`

Data is stored in `~/.jarvis/quick-notes/notes.json` (or `JARVIS_QUICK_NOTES_PATH`).
