# Heartbeat — JARVIS ROG Ed.

Short checklist for periodic heartbeat runs. Keep this file tiny to avoid token burn.

## Today
- [ ] Check if user needs anything (reply HEARTBEAT_OK if nothing)
- [ ] Note any pending reminders or follow-ups from recent chats

## Optional
- [ ] Summarize system health if performance-monitor is enabled
- [ ] Suggest one quick win (e.g. "Want me to take a screenshot of your setup?")

If nothing needs attention, reply with: **HEARTBEAT_OK**
