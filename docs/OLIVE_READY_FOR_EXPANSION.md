# Olive — Ready for expansion & feedback checklist

Use this checklist to keep Olive ready for friends, family, and beta testers.

---

## Documentation (done)

- [x] **Project overview & feedback** — [docs/OLIVE_PROJECT_README.md](./OLIVE_PROJECT_README.md): what Olive is, try it, give feedback, beta testers, expansion.
- [x] **Repo index** — [docs/REPO_INDEX.md](./REPO_INDEX.md) links to Olive doc and olive repo.
- [x] **Feedback one-pager** — [docs/OLIVE_FEEDBACK.md](./OLIVE_FEEDBACK.md): short “how to give feedback” (can be copied into Olive repo root as FEEDBACK.md or linked from Olive README).

## In the Olive repo (repairman29/olive)

When you work in the Olive repo, ensure:

- [ ] **README** — One-paragraph description, link to shopolive.xyz, “Give feedback” → GitHub Issues or this doc.
- [ ] **FEEDBACK.md or /help** — Short “how to give feedback” (in-app, direct, GitHub). Olive already has /help; add a “Feedback” section or link to GitHub Issues.
- [ ] **Product manual** — docs/OLIVE_PRODUCT_MASTER_MANUAL.md (voice, tokens, Granny logic, Next (Olive)).
- [ ] **Troubleshooting** — docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md (auth, 503, store, recipes).

## Feedback channels

- **In-app:** Post-haul “How did we do?” (if enabled).
- **Direct:** Email / text / DM to you.
- **GitHub:** [github.com/repairman29/olive/issues](https://github.com/repairman29/olive/issues) — invite friends to open an issue (bug, idea, or praise).

## Before sharing with friends & family

- [ ] Live app works: shopolive.xyz loads, sign-in, add item, connect Kroger (if applicable), add to cart.
- [ ] Help page is clear: shopolive.xyz/help.
- [ ] You have one clear place for feedback (e.g. “Reply to this email” or “Open an issue at github.com/repairman29/olive/issues”).

## Optional for expansion

- [ ] Add “Send feedback” link in Olive footer or Help → points to GitHub Issues or a short Typeform/Google Form.
- [ ] In Olive README: “We’re in beta — feedback welcome” + link to FEEDBACK.md or Issues.
- [ ] Changelog or “What’s new” (e.g. in Help or a simple markdown file) so testers see progress.

**Summary:** Documentation in CLAWDBOT is in place. In the Olive repo, add a visible “Give feedback” entry point (README + optional FEEDBACK.md) and keep Help and troubleshooting docs up to date.
