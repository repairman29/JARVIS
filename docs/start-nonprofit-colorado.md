# How to Start a Nonprofit Fast in Colorado

**What’s quick:** Incorporating in Colorado (often same-day online).  
**What’s slow:** IRS 501(c)(3) approval (weeks to a few months).

---

## 1. Prepare (do this first)

- **Name** – Unique, not already in use. Check: [Colorado Secretary of State](https://www.coloradosos.gov)
- **Mission/purpose** – Written so it fits IRS charitable purposes (education, charity, etc.); use or adapt language from the [CO SOS Articles of Incorporation help](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/business/helpFiles/ARTINC_NPC_HELP.html) and sample form
- **Board** – At least one director (more is better); identify who they are
- **Registered agent** – Colorado address for service of process (you or a registered agent service)

---

## 2. Incorporate (the fast step)

- **File Articles of Incorporation** online with the [Colorado Secretary of State](https://www.coloradosos.gov)
- **Fee:** $50 (credit/debit online)
- Use the [Nonprofit Corporation checklist (PDF)](https://www.coloradosos.gov/pubs/business/helpFiles/NonprofitCorpChecklist.pdf) so you don’t miss anything
- Once accepted, you’re a Colorado nonprofit corporation (often same day if filed online)

---

## 3. Right after incorporation

- **EIN** – Apply online at [IRS.gov](https://www.irs.gov) (EIN application); you usually get it immediately
- **Bylaws** – Adopt bylaws and hold your first board meeting (minutes + resolutions)
- **Policies** – Put in place conflict of interest, document retention, and any other policies required for 501(c)(3) and good practice

## 4. Tax exemption (the slow part)

- **501(c)(3):** File [Form 1023](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1023) or **1023-EZ** (if you qualify—e.g., projected revenue under $50k) via the IRS
- **Fees:** $850 for full 1023; $400 for 1023-EZ when eligible
- IRS review usually takes weeks to several months. You can operate as a nonprofit corporation before approval; donations generally won’t be tax-deductible until you get the determination letter

---

## 5. If you’ll ask for donations in Colorado

- **Register as a charitable organization** with the [Colorado Secretary of State](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/charities/instructions/charity/registration.html) (**before** soliciting). Fee: $10

---

## To move as fast as possible

1. Use the **CO SOS online filing** for Articles of Incorporation (not paper)
2. Draft Articles using the **official sample/help** so IRS-required language is correct the first time
3. If your size and activities qualify, use **Form 1023-EZ** to shorten IRS review
4. Optional: use a **formation/registered agent service** (e.g. [Northwest Registered Agent](https://www.northwestregisteredagent.com/nonprofit/colorado)) to handle filing and registered agent so you don’t lose time on mistakes

**Bottom line:** You can have a **Colorado nonprofit corporation** in a day or so by filing online with the SOS. The main delay is **501(c)(3)**; prepare the 1023/1023-EZ and supporting docs well so the IRS doesn’t send it back.
