# How to give Olive feedback

**Olive** is in beta. Your feedback helps us improve it for everyone.

## Try Olive

- **Live app:** [shopolive.xyz](https://shopolive.xyz)
- Sign in (Google or email) → add items or paste a list/recipe → connect Kroger → add to cart → checkout on King Soopers / Kroger.

## How to share feedback

1. **In-app** — After a haul, use “How did we do?” (Nailed it / Not quite) if you see it.
2. **Direct** — Email, text, or DM: what you did, what worked, what was confusing or wrong.
3. **GitHub** — [Open an issue](https://github.com/repairman29/olive/issues) (bug, idea, or “it was great”).

## What we care about

- Sign-in and connecting Kroger: easy or confusing?
- List / recipe paste: did it do what you expected?
- Add-to-cart: right items? Any “couldn’t add” or errors?
- Any moment you thought “I don’t know what to do next.”

Thank you for trying Olive and for your feedback.
