# 2029 and Workbench — Repo organization

## 2029 (project2029 is canonical — merge done)

- **Master repo:** `repairman29/project2029` — **keep** as the canonical Project 2029 repo.
- **Merged in:** Content from `repairman29/2029` (Flask app, app/, tests, etc.) and `repairman29/2029-versioned` (under `versioned/`) has been merged into **project2029**. See project2029’s MERGE_NOTES.md and README.md.
- **Local folder:** `~/project2029` (clone of project2029).
- **Optional:** Archive or delete the **2029** and **2029-versioned** repos on GitHub now that they’re merged.

## Workbench

- **Separate repo:** `repairman29/workbench` — **different** from 2029; keep as its own product/repo.
- **Note:** No local folder for workbench was found in home. Clone as `~/workbench` when needed.
